                    For the course "Design och Tjänsteutveckling för Internet of Things" I and three 
                    other group members were tasked with building and implementing an Internet of
                    Things system that solves a problem. One of the requirements for the project 
                    was that the system was focused on a "Smart Home" solution. My group and I decided 
                    to create a cat monitoring system that tracks the amount of food and water that
                    is left along with when the litterbox needed to be emptied.

                    The above most picture are of the scales me and one other group member created 
                    in order to monitor the amount of food and water left, we managed to get them 
                    precise to as low as half a gram!. We used loading cells 
                    coupled with HX711-chips to amplify their signal connected to ESP32s in order 
                    to reach a desired effectiveness. We implemented the software with the help of an 
                    open source C-Library for the HX711-chip in the Arduino IDE. We then transmitted
                    information from the scales to our user interface over an MQTT server.

                    Whilst one half of the group focused on creating the scales the other half of the 
                    group created a motion detection system with the help of a PIR-sensor in order to
                    know when and how much the cat used the litterbox. Along with this they also created 
                    a user interface that displayed all the information transmitted to it.
